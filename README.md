# Python & JAVA Solutions for Leetcode (inspired by [haoel's leetcode](https://github.com/haoel/leetcode))

Remember solutions are only solutions to given problems. If you want full study checklist for code & whiteboard interview, please turn to [jwasham's coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

Also, there are open source implementations for basic data structs and algorithms, such as [Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) and [Algorithms in Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java).

I'm currently working on [Analytics-Zoo](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo) - an unified Data Analytics and AI platform. Check it out, if you are interested in big data and deep learning.
