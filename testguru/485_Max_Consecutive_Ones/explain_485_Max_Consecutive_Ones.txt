This is a Python class called `Solution` with a method called `findMaxConsecutiveOnes`. 

The method takes in a list of integers called `nums` and returns an integer value.

The logic of the method is to keep track of the current length of consecutive 1s encountered in the array. It starts by initializing two variables, `ans` and `curr`, to 0. `ans` will keep track of the maximum consecutive 1s encountered so far while `curr` will keep track of the current length of consecutive 1s.

The method then loops through each element in the input array `nums`. If the current element is 1, it adds 1 to `curr` and checks if `curr` is greater than `ans`. If it is, it updates `ans` to `curr`.

If the current element is not 1, it means the current streak of consecutive 1s has been broken, so `curr` is reset back to 0.

After the loop is finished, `ans` will hold the maximum consecutive 1s encountered in the input array, which is then returned.
