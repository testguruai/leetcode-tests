This code defines a class called Solution with a method called isHappy that takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value. The method checks whether the given number is a happy number or not.

A happy number is defined as a number where the sum of the squares of its digits eventually converges to 1. For example, 19 is a happy number because:

1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 

The method starts by creating an empty set called seen_numbers, which will be used to keep track of numbers seen during the calculation. Then, it enters a loop that continues while n is greater than 1 and n has not been seen before. Inside the loop, the current value of n is added to the set of seen numbers, and then n is updated to be the sum of the squares of its digits. 

Finally, the method returns a boolean value indicating whether n is equal to 1, which means it's a happy number, or not equal to 1, which means it's not a happy number.
