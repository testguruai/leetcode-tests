This is a Python class called "Solution" that has one method called "numDistinct". The method takes in two string arguments "s" and "t" and returns an integer value. 

The method is using dynamic programming to solve a problem where we need to find the number of distinct subsequences of string t in string s. The solution is stored in a matrix called "dp". We initialize this matrix using two loops. The first loop initializes the first row to zeros, and the second loop initializes the first column to ones. 

Next, we use two nested loops to fill up the rest of the matrix using the formula:

    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])

This formula takes into account two cases: 
1) when the current character in s doesn't match the current character in t (i.e., s[i-1] != t[j-1]), we only need to copy the number of distinct subsequences up to the previous character in s (dp[i-1][j]). 
2) when the current character in s matches the current character in t (i.e., s[i-1] == t[j-1]), in addition to copying the value from the previous character in s (dp[i-1][j]), we add the number of distinct subsequences that could come from the match (dp[i-1][j-1]).

Finally, we return the value stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix "dp[-1][-1]" which represents the number of distinct subsequences of t in s.
