This code defines a class called Solution with a method called `isPowerOfFour` that determines whether an integer number is a power of 4 or not. The method takes an integer `num` as input and returns a boolean value.

The method first checks if the given number is greater than 0. If it is not greater than 0, then it cannot be a power of 4. If it is greater than 0, then it proceeds to the next step.

The method then checks if the given number has only one bit set to 1, which is the characteristic property of power of 2. This is done using the `num & (num-1) == 0` condition. If it does not have only one bit set to 1, then it cannot be a power of 4.

Finally, the method checks if the position of the set bit is even or odd. If it is even, then the given number is a power of 4; otherwise, it is not. This is done using the `len(bin(num)[3:]) % 2 == 0` condition, where `bin(num)[3:]` converts the given number into a binary string and skips the initial '0b' prefix, and `len()` returns the length of the binary string.
