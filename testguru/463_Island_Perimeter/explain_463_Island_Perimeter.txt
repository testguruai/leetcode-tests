This code defines a Python class named `Solution` and contains a method `islandPerimeter()`. This method takes a 2D list `grid` as an input and returns an integer value, which is the perimeter of the island formed by the values of `grid`.

The method starts by calculating the number of rows and columns in the `grid`. If either of them is equal to zero, it means that there is no island, and hence, the method returns a perimeter of zero.

Then, it initializes two variables `islands` and `overlaps` to zero. These variables keep track of the number of islands and overlaps in the `grid`, respectively.

The method then loops through all the elements in the `grid` and checks if the current element is equal to 1, which means it is a part of the island. If yes, the `islands` variable is incremented by 1.

The method then checks the neighboring element in the right and down directions using the conditional statements. If any of them is also equal to 1, it means that there is an overlap between two islands, and the `overlaps` variable is incremented by 1.

Finally, the method calculates the perimeter of the island by subtracting the number of overlaps multiplied by 2 from the number of islands multiplied by 4, which gives the total length of the boundaries of all islands in the `grid`.

In summary, the `islandPerimeter()` method calculates the perimeter of the island by counting the number of islands and overlaps in the `grid` and subtracting the overlaps from the total length of the boundaries of all islands.
