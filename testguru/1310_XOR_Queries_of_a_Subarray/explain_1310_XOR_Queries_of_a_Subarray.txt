This Python code is a class called "Solution" that contains a method called "xorQueries". This method takes in two parameters: an array of numbers called "arr" and a list of queries. Each query is a list of two integers indicating a range of indices within "arr". The method returns a list with the same length as the list of queries, where each element of the list is the xor of the numbers in the specified range.

The method first creates a new list called "pref", which will store the accumulated xor values of the numbers in "arr". It starts with a single element 0, and loops through each number in "arr". For each number, it calculates the xor with the last element in "pref" and adds it to the end of the list.

Next, the method loops through each query, calculates the xor of the accumulated xors in "pref" from the range specified by the query, and appends it to the "ans" list.

The method then returns the "ans" list.

There is also a commented out version of the "xorQueries" method that uses a different approach, where it first loops through "arr" and modifies each element to be the xor of itself and the previous element. It then iterates through each query and calculates the xor of the corresponding elements in "arr" using the modified values. The result is returned as a list.
