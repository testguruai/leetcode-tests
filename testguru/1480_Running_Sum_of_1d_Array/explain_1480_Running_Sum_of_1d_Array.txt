This is a Python class named `Solution` with a method named `runningSum` which takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of integers as output. 

The `runningSum` method first checks whether the input list is None or empty, and if so, returns the input list as is.

If the input list is not None or empty, the method uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of the input list from the second element to the last element (the first element is not modified). For each index `i`, the method adds the value at that index to the value at the previous index (`i-1`) and replaces the value at index `i` with the sum. 

After the for loop completes, the method returns the modified list. 

There is also a commented out method definition that uses Python's `accumulate()` method to achieve the same result as the current implementation.
