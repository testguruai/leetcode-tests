This is a Python implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, used to shuffle a list of numbers. The code defines a class called 'Solution' that has three methods: '__init__', 'reset', and 'shuffle'. 

The '__init__' method is a constructor that takes a list of integers as input, saves a copy of the original list in an attribute called 'origin', initializes another attribute called 'curr' with a copy of the input list, and saves the length of the list in an attribute called 'size'. 

The 'reset' method resets the list to its original configuration by copying 'origin' back into 'curr'. 

The 'shuffle' method performs the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It loops through the list from the first item to the last, choosing a random position in the list up to that point and swapping the current item with the item at the chosen position. Finally, it returns the shuffled list. 

The last few lines of code provide an example of how to create an instance of the 'Solution' class and call its 'reset' and 'shuffle' methods.
