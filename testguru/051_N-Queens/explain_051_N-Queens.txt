This is a Python code for solving the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In this implementation, the solution is computed recursively.

The code defines a class Solution, where the method solveNQueens takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the chessboard, and returns a list of possible solutions, where each solution is represented by a list of strings (the placement of the queens on the board). 

The method do_solveNQueens is a helper method that is called recursively to compute the solutions. It takes three arguments: the list of results, the current state of the chessboard, and the number of queens left to be placed. 

The method first checks whether all queens have been placed on the board (by checking whether num==0). If so, it appends the current state of the board to the list of results and returns. 

If not, the method iterates through the rows of the board (from the current position to the last row), and for each row, it checks which columns are safe to place a queen in. It does this by iterating through the columns of the board and checking whether each column and its diagonals are safe to place a queen in. If a column is found to be safe, the method places a queen in that column and calls itself recursively to place the remaining queens.

When all possible solutions have been computed, the method returns the list of results. The code includes a brief testing block that prints the solutions for a 4x4 chessboard.
