This is a Python class named `Solution` which has a method called `isIsomorphic` that takes two string arguments `s` and `t`. 

The first commented method is an alternate implementation of the `isIsomorphic` function which checks every character of the strings `s` and `t`. It first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal, then creates a boolean array `check` with the length of `s` to keep track of which characters have been checked. A loop operates over the length of `s`. If a character in `s` has already been checked, then the loop continues to the next character. If it hasn't been checked before, then it counts the number of occurrences of that character in `s` and `t`. If those counts are unequal, it returns `False`. If both character counts are greater than or equal to 2, then it checks the rest of the string to see if all occurrences of that character match between `s` and `t`. It then marks each character in `check` which matches the current character so that they don't get checked again. In the end, if all checks pass, it returns `True`.

The second implementation calculates the mapping between all characters in the two strings. It first checks if the lengths of the two strings differ. Then it initializes two arrays with the length of 127. For each character in the two strings, it calculates their ASCII ordinal value using the `ord` function. It checks if both arrays have the mappings of each character to the other string's character as 0. If that is the case, then it sets up the mapping between the two characters. But if any mapping was previously set between one character to a different character, then it returns `False`. Finally, if all checks pass, it returns `True`.
