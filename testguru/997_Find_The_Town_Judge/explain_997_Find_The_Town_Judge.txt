This is a python function to solve a problem related to finding a judge in a town. 

The function `findJudge` takes two arguments, `N` and `trust`. `N` is an integer representing the number of people in the town, and `trust` is a list of lists representing trust relationships between pairs of people in the town. Each sub-list in `trust` contains two integers `i` and `j`, indicating that person `i` trusts person `j`.

The function checks if there is only one person in the town. If so, then that person is the judge, and the function returns 1.

If there is more than one person in the town, the function proceeds to create two dictionaries: `d1` and `d2`. `d1` is used to store the number of people who trust a particular person, while `d2` is used to store the number of people a particular person trusts. 

The function then loops through all the sub-lists in `trust` and increments the corresponding values in `d1` and `d2` dictionaries.

After that, the function loops through the items in the `d1` dictionary, looking for a person with `N-1` trusts. If such a person is found and they're not in `d2`, then that person is the judge and the function returns their id.

If no such person is found, the function returns -1, indicating that there is no judge in the town.
