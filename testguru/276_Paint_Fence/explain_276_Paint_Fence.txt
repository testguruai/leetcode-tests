This is a Python class "Solution" that has a method "numWays" which takes two parameters, n and k, and returns an integer. The method uses dynamic programming to solve a problem of painting n posts with k colors such that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.

The first implementation of "numWays" has been commented out and the second implementation is being used. The first implementation uses a list "w" to store the number of ways to paint the posts such that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color. The list is initialized with three values, 0, k, k*k, which represent the number of ways to paint 0, 1, and 2 posts. Then, the list is iteratively updated by adding the sum of the last two values multiplied by (k-1), which represents the number of ways to paint the next post with a different color than the previous two posts. The method returns the last element of the list, which represents the number of ways to paint n posts.

The second implementation uses two variables "dp" to store the number of ways to paint the posts for the current and previous steps. At first, dp[0] is set to k (the number of ways to paint one post with k colors), and dp[1] is set to k*k (the number of ways to paint two posts with k colors such that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color). Then, the method iteratively updates dp by calculating the number of ways to paint i posts using the formula (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) * (k-1), which represents the number of ways to paint the i-th post with a different color than the previous two posts. The method returns dp[1], which represents the number of ways to paint n posts.
