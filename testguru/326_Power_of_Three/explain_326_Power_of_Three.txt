This is a Python class that contains a method to check if a given integer is a power of 3.

The method is named `isPowerOfThree` and takes an integer `n` as its parameter.

The commented out code block above the method appears to be an alternate implementation of the method using logarithmic calculations. However, it is not currently being used in the class.

The active implementation uses a pre-calculated maximum value of 3 raised to the power of 19 (i.e. 3^19), which is stored in the variable `max3pow`. If the given integer `n` is not positive or exceeds this maximum value, the method returns False.

If `n` is a valid input value, the method checks if `max3pow` is divisible by `n`. If it is, then `n` is a power of 3 and the method returns True. Otherwise, `n` is not a power of 3 and the method returns False.
