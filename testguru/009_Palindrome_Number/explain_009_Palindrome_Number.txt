This is a code for checking whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. 

The code defines a class called "Solution" with a method called "isPalindrome". The input to this method is an integer "x" and the output is a boolean value indicating whether "x" is a palindrome or not. 

The first line of the method converts the integer to a string. The second line checks whether the string is equal to its reverse (achieved using slicing with [::-1]). If it is, then the method returns True, else it returns False. 

There are also four other commented out methods for checking for palindromes, but they are not used in the code. 

Finally, the method is tested for an example input of 1001 using a newly created instance of the "Solution" class.
