The code defines a class Solution with one method sortColors that takes in a list of integers called nums and modifies it in place without returning anything.

The first implementation of sortColors uses a simple counting sort algorithm that counts the occurrences of each integer in nums and then reassigns the values of nums by iterating through the count array.

The second implementation of sortColors uses a three-pointer approach to partition the array into three regions: low (where all values are 0), mid (where all values are 1), and high (where all values are 2). The mid pointer iterates through nums, while the low pointer indicates the end of the low region and the high pointer indicates the beginning of the high region. Whenever the mid pointer encounters a 0, it swaps the value at the mid pointer with the value at the low pointer and increments both pointers. Whenever the mid pointer encounters a 2, it swaps the value at the mid pointer with the value at the high pointer and decrements the high pointer. If the mid pointer encounters a 1, it simply increments the mid pointer. This process partitions the array into the three regions without using any extra space.
