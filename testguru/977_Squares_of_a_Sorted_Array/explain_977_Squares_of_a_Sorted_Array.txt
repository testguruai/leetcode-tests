This is a class named `Solution` with a method `sortedSquares` that takes in a list of integers `A` and returns a new list of sorted squares of the original integers in `A`.

The first implementation is commented out and is a simple one-liner that uses list comprehension to square each element of `A`, then sorts the resulting list. However, it is not optimal as it has to sort the entire list even though it is already sorted except for the negative values.

The second implementation uses two pointers, `pos` and `npos`, to keep track of the current positions of positive and negative values, respectively, in `A`. It first finds the first positive value in `A` and sets `pos` to its index. It then sets `npos` to the index before `pos`.

It then initializes an empty list `res` and starts a `while` loop that continues until either one of the pointers reaches the end of `A`. It compares the squares of the values at the current positions of `pos` and `npos`. If the square of the value at `npos` is larger, it appends it to the `res` list and moves `npos` down one index. If not, it appends the square of the value at `pos` to `res` and moves `pos` up one index.

After that, there will still be some elements left unappended in `A`. Therefore, it appends the remaining squares of the negative values in `A` to `res`, followed by the remaining squares of the positive values in `A`.

Finally, it returns the sorted `res` list.
