This code is an implementation of the "Jump Game" problem in Python. The `canJump` function takes an array `nums` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array starting from the first index.

The implementation uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It starts from the end of the array and checks if the index can be reached from any of the previous indices. If it can be reached, it updates the starting index to the current index and continues the loop. If it cannot be reached, it returns `False`.

If the loop completes successfully without finding any unreachable indices, the function returns `True`.

The `reversed` function is used to iterate through the array in reverse order, starting from the second to last index. This is done to avoid checking unreachable indices.

The `length` variable stores the length of the input array for convenience.

The function returns `not begin`, which is equivalent to `begin == 0`. This is because if `begin` is equal to 0, it means that the first index can be reached from the last index, which implies that the last index can be reached from the first index. Thus, the function returns `True`. If `begin` is greater than 0, it means that the last index cannot be reached from the first index, so the function returns `False`.
