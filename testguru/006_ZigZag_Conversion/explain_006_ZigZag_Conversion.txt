This is a Python class called `Solution` which defines a function called `convert` that takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `numRows`. The function rearranges the string `s` into a zig-zag pattern with `numRows` rows and returns the rearranged string.

The original function (`convert` function in the comments) creates a `temp_s` list and uses nested loops to fill it with the characters of the input string. The loops go back and forth, up and down the zig-zag pattern. The function then joins the list elements to form the final string.

The updated `convert` function uses a simpler approach to rearrange the string. It calculates the period (a repeating pattern of the zig-zag) and initializes a list `result`. It then iterates through the input string, computes the index of the row to add the current character to, and updates the `result` list. Finally, the function joins the list elements to form the final string.

The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block at the end of the code creates an instance of the `Solution` class and calls the `convert` function with the input `"PAYPALISHIRING"` and `3` for `numRows`. The output is `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`.
