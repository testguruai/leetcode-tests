The code defines a class called Solution with a function called removeDuplicates that takes a list of integers called nums as input. The function removes duplicates from the list and returns the length of the new list with unique elements.

The first implementation of the function iterates through the elements of the input list, checks if any element is equal to the previous element and continues if it is, or adds the element to the new list if it is not. This is achieved by using a for loop and a conditional statement to check the current element against the previous element, and a counter to keep track of the index of the new list. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n).

The second implementation is a simpler and more efficient approach to removing duplicates from a sorted array. It uses a two-pointer approach, where the first pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the second pointer iterates through the array. If the value at the second pointer is equal to the value at the first pointer, the second pointer moves to the next element. If the value at the second pointer is not equal to the value at the first pointer, the first pointer moves to the next element and the value at the second pointer is assigned to the new element at the position of the first pointer. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as it modifies the input array in place without creating a new list.
