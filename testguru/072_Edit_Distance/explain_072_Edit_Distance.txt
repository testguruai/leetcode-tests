This is a Python program for computing the minimum edit distance between two given words using the dynamic programming approach. The program defines a class called "Solution" that contains a method "minDistance" which takes two string arguments "word1" and "word2" representing the two words for which minimum edit distance is to be computed. 

The first method defined in the class uses a two-dimensional array to store the minimum edit distances for each prefix of the two words, and fills up the array using a nested loop that checks whether the i-th character of word1 matches the j-th character of word2, and computes the minimum of three possible values corresponding to three different types of edit operations, namely deletion, insertion, and replacement. The program then returns the value in the bottom-right cell of the array, which represents the minimum edit distance between the two complete words.

The second method defined in the class is a space-optimized version that only requires a one-dimensional array to store the minimum edit distances for the prefixes of the two words. The program initializes the array with integers from 0 to the length of word1, and then iterates over every j-th character of word2, updating the array values for the corresponding prefix of each i-th character of word1. The program uses a temporary variable "pre" to store the previous value of the array, and updates the array with the minimum of three possible values that correspond to three different types of edit operations, namely deletion, insertion, and replacement. Finally, the program returns the value in the last cell of the array, which represents the minimum edit distance between the two complete words.

The program also contains a main block that creates an instance of the Solution class, calls the "minDistance" method with two sample string inputs, and prints the resulting minimum edit distance for each input.
