This is a python class named Solution which contains a method called "search". This method takes two arguments: a list of integers called "nums", and an integer called "target". The method returns an integer which is the index of the target element in the nums list or -1 if the target element is not in the list.

The "search" method uses the binary search algorithm to search for the target element in an ordered list of integers. The search algorithm is carried out in a helper function called "get", which takes two arguments: "start" and "end". The function recursively searches for the target element by dividing the list into two halves and checking which half is sorted. If the left half is sorted, the function checks if the target element exists in that half, and if it does, it recursively searches that half. If the right half is sorted, the function does the same thing. If the target element is found, the function returns its index, otherwise it returns -1.

The "search" method calls the "get" function with parameters "0" and "len(nums) - 1", which indicates that the search should be performed on the entire list. Finally, the "search" method returns the result returned by the "get" function.
