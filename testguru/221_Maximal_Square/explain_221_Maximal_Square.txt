This is a python class Solution that defines a method maximalSquare, which takes a matrix as an input and returns the maximum size of the square that can be formed with all 1's in the matrix.
There are three different implementations of the method that are commented out. The first implementation is a brute force approach that has a time complexity of O(mn^2). The second implementation is a dynamic programming approach that has a time complexity of O(mn) and space complexity of O(mn). The third implementation is also a dynamic programming approach, but it uses only O(n) space.
The third implementation uses an array dp to keep track of the maximum square size that can be formed at the current position. The value of dp[j] is calculated using the values of dp[j-1] (the maximum square size at the previous column), dp[j] (the maximum square size at the current position in the previous row), and prev (the maximum square size at the previous position in the current row), and the minimum of these values is added to 1. The value of prev is stored in a temporary variable temp so that it can be used in the next iteration. If the current element in the matrix is 0, then dp[j] is set to 0. The variable res keeps track of the maximum square size seen so far. The method returns the square of res to get the area of the largest square.
