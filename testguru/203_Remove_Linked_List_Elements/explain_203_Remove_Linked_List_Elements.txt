This code defines a class Solution that contains a method removeElements. The method takes two arguments - head, a linked list, and val, an integer value. The method removes all occurrences of nodes with value equal to val from the linked list. 

To perform this, an extra node prehead is added and is initialized with the value -1. The next pointer of prehead points to the head of the linked list. Using two pointers last and pos, the linked list is iterated over. If the value of the current node, pos, matches the given value, val, then the next pointer of the previous node, last, is changed to point to the next node of pos, effectively removing the node with the given value from the list. If the value does not match, last is updated to point to the current node, pos. Finally, the method returns the linked list with all occurrences of nodes with the value equal to val removed.
