This code defines a class called Solution with a method called generate that takes an integer parameter numRows. The method generates a list of lists (2D list) with numRows rows and each row containing i+1 elements. The list is filled with zeros initially.

Then, the method loops through each row and each element of that row. If the element is the first or last element of the row (when j is 0 or i), it sets the value to 1 since those elements represent the ends of Pascal's triangle. Otherwise, it sets the value to the sum of the two values above it in the previous row.

Finally, the updated list is returned as the output. This code generates the Pascal's triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients.
