This code defines a class Solution. Within Solution, there is a method shortestDistance that takes three arguments: words, word1, and word2. The objective of this method is to find the shortest distance between word1 and word2 in the list words.

The first implementation of the shortestDistance method assigns an empty list called indexes. A for loop enumerates through each word in words. If the word is equal to word1, then the tuple (index, 1) is appended to the indexes list. If the word is equal to word2, then the tuple (index, 2) is appended to the indexes list. After all words in words have been evaluated, the length of the indexes list is stored in a variable called ls and the length of words is stored in a variable called min_range. Another for loop is then used to iterate through each tuple in the indexes list, excluding the last tuple. If the values in the current tuple and the following tuple are equal, then the for loop continues to the next tuple. But if the values are not equal, then the absolute difference between the indexes of the tuples is computed and stored in a variable called curr_range. If curr_range is less than min_range, then curr_range is assigned to min_range. Finally, min_range is returned.

The second implementation of the shortestDistance method assigns -1 to variables index1 and index2, as well as assigns len(words) to a variable called res. A for loop enumerates through each word in words. If the word is equal to word1, then the current index is assigned to index1. If the word is equal to word2, then the current index is assigned to index2. If index1 and index2 are not equal to -1, then the absolute difference between index1 and index2 is computed. If this absolute difference is less than res, then the absolute difference is assigned to res. Finally, res is returned.
