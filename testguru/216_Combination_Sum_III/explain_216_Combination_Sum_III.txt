This is a Python code that defines a class Solution with a method `combinationSum3` which takes in two integer arguments k and n and returns a list of lists of integers as the output.

The function uses the `itertools` module, which provides various functions used for creating iterators. The `itertools.combinations()` function returns all possible combinations of a given range of numbers and k items.

The function uses `list(it.combinations(range(1, 10), k))` to generate all possible combinations of elements from 1 to 9 with length k, then filters the results using `it.ifilter(lambda x: sum(x) == n, ...)` to only include those combinations whose sum is equal to the given integer n. Finally, the result is returned as a list of lists using the `list()` function.
