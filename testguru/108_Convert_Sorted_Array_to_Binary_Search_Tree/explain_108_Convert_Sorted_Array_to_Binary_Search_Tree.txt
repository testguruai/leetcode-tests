This is a Python solution for constructing a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array. The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `sortedArrayToBST` that takes in a sorted array of integers and returns the root node of a balanced binary search tree.

The first implementation of `sortedArrayToBST` uses recursion with slicing. The base case is when there are no elements in the array, in which case it returns `None`. Otherwise, it finds the middle element of the array and sets it as the root of the current subtree. It then recursively constructs the left and right subtrees by passing in the left and right halves of the array, respectively.

The second implementation of `sortedArrayToBST` uses recursion with indices. It calls a helper function `getHelper` that takes in the sorted array, the starting index, and the ending index of the current subtree. If the starting index is greater than the ending index, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it finds the middle index and sets the middle element as the root of the current subtree. It then recursively constructs the left and right subtrees by passing in the range of indices corresponding to the left and right halves of the array, respectively.

Both implementations have the same time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sorted array.
