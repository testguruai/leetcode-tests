This is a Python implementation of a solution to the problem of finding the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring in a given string of parentheses. 

The code defines a class `Solution`, with a method `longestValidParentheses` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer, which represents the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in `s`. 

The code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the indices of the opening parentheses `(` in the string. For each closing parentheses `)` encountered in `s`, the code checks whether there is a matching opening parentheses in the stack. If there is, it marks the indices of the matching opening and closing parentheses as valid (by setting the corresponding elements of an array `data` to 1). 

Finally, the code scans the `data` array to count the length of each valid substring of parentheses and returns the maximum length found. 

The code also defines another implementation of the solution using dynamic programming, but it has been commented out.
