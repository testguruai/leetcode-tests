The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findUnsortedSubarray` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the length of the shortest possible contiguous subarray that, if sorted, would result in a sorted `nums` list.

The first implementation of the method uses a sorting algorithm. It creates a sorted copy of the original list called `snums`, initializes `start` to the length of the list, and initializes `end` to zero. Then, it loops through each element of the original `nums` list and compares it to the corresponding element in `snums`. If they are not equal, it means that the element is not in its proper position and should be part of the unsorted subarray. The method updates `start` and `end` to keep track of the indices of the subarray. If `end` is greater than or equal to `start`, it means that there is an unsorted subarray, so the method returns its length (`end - start + 1`). Otherwise, it means that the list is already sorted, so the method returns zero.

The second implementation of the method uses a stack data structure. It initializes two variables `l` and `r` to, respectively, the length of the list and zero. It then loops through each element of the list and performs the following operations:

1. While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has a greater value than the current element, remove the top element from the stack and update the value of `l` to be the minimum of its current value and the index of the removed element.
2. Append the current index to the stack.

The result of this loop is that the stack will contain indices of the list in increasing order of value. Moreover, `l` will have the value of the index of the first element from the left that is not in its proper position.

The method then loops through the list in reverse order and performs the following operations:

1. While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has a smaller value than the current element, remove the top element from the stack and update the value of `r` to be the maximum of its current value and the index of the removed element.
2. Append the current index to the stack.

The result of this loop is that the stack will contain indices of the list in decreasing order of value. Moreover, `r` will have the value of the index of the last element from the right that is not in its proper position.

If `r` is greater than `l`, it means that there is an unsorted subarray, so the method returns its length (`r - l + 1`). Otherwise, it means that the list is already sorted, so the method returns zero.

The third implementation of the method uses a different approach. It initializes two variables `smin` and `smax` to, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of a 32-bit integer. It also initializes a boolean variable `flag` to `False`. The method then loops through the list from left to right and sets `flag` to `True` if it finds an element that is not in its proper position (i.e., it is smaller than the previous element). If `flag` is `True`, the method updates the value of `smin` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the current element.

The method then loops through the list from right to left and performs a similar operation but using `smax` instead of `smin`. Finally, the method loops through the list from left to right and finds the index `l` of the first element that is greater than `smin`. It then loops through the list from right to left and finds the index `r` of the last element that is smaller than `smax`.

If `r` is greater than `l`, it means that there is an unsorted subarray, so the method returns its length (`r - l + 1`). Otherwise, it means that the list is already sorted, so the method returns zero.

The first and second implementations have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, while the third implementation has a time complexity of O(n) due to the three loops through the list. The second implementation, using a stack, has a space complexity of O(n) due to the stack data structure. The other two implementations have a space complexity of O(1) because they only use a few variables.
