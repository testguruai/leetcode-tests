This Python code defines a class named Solution with a method called minMoves. The method takes a list of integers called nums as an argument and returns an integer.

The method first checks if the list is None or empty. If it is, the method returns 0.

Otherwise, the method finds the minimum value in the list using the min() function and assigns it to the variable min_num.

The method then calculates the sum of the differences between each value in the list and the minimum value. This is done using a list comprehension that generates a list of the differences. The sum() function is used to calculate the total of this list.

Finally, the method returns the total, which represents the minimum number of moves required to make all elements in the list equal. Specifically, each move consists of incrementing n - 1 elements by 1, where n is the length of the list.
