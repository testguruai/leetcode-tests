This Python code defines a solution class with a method called 'lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct'. The method takes in one parameter s, which is a string and returns an integer. The objective of the function is to find and return the length of the longest substring in the given string s that contains at most two distinct characters.

The method uses three variables, i, j, and maxLen. The value of i is initially set to 0, and the value of j is set to -1. The value of maxLen is initially set to 0.

The method uses a for-loop to iterate through all the characters of the given string, except for the first character. The for-loop uses the variable k as an index to traverse through the string. There are two main if-statements inside the for-loop.

The first if-statement checks if the current character is the same as the previous character. If that's true, then it continues to the next iteration.

The second if-statement checks if there are already two distinct characters in the current substring. If yes, then it stores the length of the current substring and updates the start index i to the position right after the last occurrence of the second distinct character.

Then, the current index (k) becomes the last occurrence of the second distinct character, and the maxLen variable updates with the maximum length of the substring found so far.

Finally, the method returns the maximum length found by comparing the length of the substring that starts at index i and the maxLen variable.
