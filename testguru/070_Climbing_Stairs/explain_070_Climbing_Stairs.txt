The given code contains a class `Solution` which has a method `climbStairs` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer representing the number of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs.

The first part of the code is commented out, but it follows a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes a list `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements initialized to 0, sets the first two elements to 1, and then iteratively fills out the list from index 2 to index `n` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`. Finally, it returns the last element of the list, which represents the number of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs.

The second part of the code implements the same algorithm using only two variables `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case there is only one way to climb the stairs (either by not climbing at all or by climbing one step). Otherwise, it initializes `dp` to `[1, 1]` and uses a for loop to iteratively update `dp` from index 2 to index `n` using the recurrence relation `dp[1] = dp[1] + dp[0]` and `dp[0] = dp[1]`. Finally, it returns `dp[1]`, which represents the number of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs.

The third part of the code is also commented out, but it implements the same algorithm using a memoization technique. It uses a dictionary `C` to store the results for previously calculated values of `n`. If `n` is already in `C`, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value using the recurrence relation `C[n] = C[n-1] + C[n-2]` and stores it in `C` before returning it.
