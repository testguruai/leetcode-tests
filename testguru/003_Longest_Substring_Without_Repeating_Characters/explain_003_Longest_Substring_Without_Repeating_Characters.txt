The code defines a class named `Solution` with a method named `lengthOfLongestSubstring` that takes a string `s` as its argument and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The code contains different versions of the `lengthOfLongestSubstring` method. The commented-out methods are not used in the final version of the code. The final version of the method uses a dictionary named `charMap` to keep track of the last index of each character in the string `s`. The `max_len` variable is used to store the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, and the `i` variable is used to store the starting index of the current substring.

The code loops over the characters in the string `s` using the variable `j`. If the character at `j` is already in the current substring (i.e., if `charMap[ord(s[j])] >= i`), then the starting index of the substring is updated to the next index after the last occurrence of that character (i.e., `i = charMap[ord(s[j])] + 1`). Otherwise, the index of the character is updated to `j` (i.e., `charMap[ord(s[j])] = j`), and the `max_len` variable is updated to the length of the current substring. Finally, the method returns the value of `max_len`.
