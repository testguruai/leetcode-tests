This is a Python implementation of a solution to the problem of determining whether it is possible to finish a set of courses given a list of prerequisites. The solution uses a simple graph-based approach to determine whether there are any cycles in the course dependency graph, which would indicate that it is not possible to complete all the courses.

The solution defines a class called Solution, which has two methods: hasCycle and canFinish.

The hasCycle method determines whether there is a cycle in the dependency graph by recursively traversing the graph. It takes four parameters:

- course: the course to check for cycles
- deps: a dictionary that maps each course to a set of courses that depend on it
- visited: a set of courses that have already been visited during the traversal
- tracker: a set of courses that are currently part of the traversal path

The method starts by adding the current course to the visited and tracker sets. It then iterates through the set of courses that depend on the current course and checks if each of those courses has already been visited. If a course has not been visited, the method recursively calls itself with that course as the new current course. If the recursive call returns True, indicating that a cycle was found, the method immediately returns True to the calling method. If a course is found to be in the tracker set, it means that a cycle has been found, so the method immediately returns True. Otherwise, the current course is removed from the tracker set and the method continues. If the method completes the loop without finding any cycles, it returns False.

The canFinish method takes two parameters:

- numCourses: the total number of courses in the set
- prerequisites: a list of tuples representing the prerequisites for each course

The method starts by creating a dictionary called deps which maps each prerequisite course to the set of courses that depend on it. It then initializes a set called visited to keep track of which courses have been visited. For each course in the set, the method calls hasCycle with that course as the current course and the other parameters initialized. If a cycle is found, it immediately returns False indicating that it is not possible to finish all the courses. If the method completes the loop without finding any cycles, it returns True indicating that it is possible to finish all the courses.
