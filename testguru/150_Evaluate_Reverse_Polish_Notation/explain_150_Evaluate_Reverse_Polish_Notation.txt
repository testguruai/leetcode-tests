This Python code defines a class Solution with a method called evalRPN. The method takes in one parameter, a list of strings called tokens. The goal of the method is to evaluate a reverse polish notation expression using a stack.

The method first initializes an empty stack. It then iterates through each token in the input list. 

If the token is an integer, it is converted to an integer and pushed onto the stack.

If the token is not an integer, it is assumed to be an operator (+, -, *, /). The method then pops the last two integers, performs the necessary operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack. The process continues until all tokens have been processed.

Finally, the method returns the last item in the stack, which should be the final result of the RPN expression.
