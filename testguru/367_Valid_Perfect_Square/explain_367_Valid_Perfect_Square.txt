The code defines a class named Solution with three methods for checking if a given number is a perfect square. Only the second method is uncommented, while the other two are commented out with `#` and not executed.

The `isPerfectSquare` method takes one argument, `num`, which is the number to be checked for being a perfect square. The method uses binary search to find the square root of the number by searching for the midpoint of the interval between low and high, where the square root of the number lies. The value of mid_square (square of the midpoint) is then compared with the given number. If mid_square is equal to num, the method returns True, indicating that the given number is a perfect square. If mid_square is less than num, the search is restricted to the right half of the interval by setting low to mid+1. Conversely, if mid_square is greater than num (meaning that the required square root lies in the left half of the interval), the search is restricted to the left half of the interval by setting high to mid - 1. If none of the search intervals yield a square root equal to num, the method returns False to indicate that num is not a perfect square.

The two other methods that are commented out are alternative implementations for the same problem. The first method uses subtraction to check for a perfect square, while the third method uses the Newton's method to iterate and find the square root of the number.
