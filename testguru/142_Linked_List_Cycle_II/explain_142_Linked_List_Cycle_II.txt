This Python code defines a class called `Solution` that has a single method called `detectCycle`. This method takes as input the `head` of a singly-linked list and tries to detect if there is a cycle in the linked list. If there is a cycle, the method returns the node at which the cycle starts. 

The method uses the two-pointer approach to detect if there is a cycle in the linked list. Two pointers `fast` and `slow` are initialized at the beginning of the list. The `fast` pointer moves two steps forward, and the `slow` pointer moves one step forward in each iteration of the while loop. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the `fast` pointer eventually catches up to the `slow` pointer. This is because the `fast` pointer is moving twice as fast as the `slow` pointer and will eventually reach the same node that the `slow` pointer is at, but from the other direction. By this point, we know that there is a cycle in the linked list.

Next, the `slow` pointer is set back to the beginning of the linked list, and both `fast` and `slow` pointers move one step at a time. Again, when `fast` and `slow` pointers meet, the node at which the cycle starts is found, and this node is returned by the method. 

If there is no cycle in the linked list, the method returns `None`.
