This is a python class that contains a method named `numberOfSteps` that takes a non-negative integer `num` as its argument and returns the number of steps required to reduce it to 0. If the given number is even, it divides it by 2, otherwise it subtracts 1 from it.

The method initializes a variable named `steps` to 0 and enters a loop that continues as long as `num` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is even by taking the modulo (`%`) with 2. If it is even, it divides `num` by 2 using the `/` operator and increments `steps` by 1. If `num` is odd, it subtracts 1 from it using the `-` operator and also increments `steps` by 1.

Finally, when `num` becomes 0, the method returns the final value of `steps`.

There are two commented out methods that have different implementations of the same logic using bit manipulation and a helper function that counts the number of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the number.
