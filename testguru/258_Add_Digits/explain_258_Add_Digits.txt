This is a definition of a `Solution` class in Python containing a method called `addDigits` that takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output.

The `addDigits` method first checks if the input number is already a single digit (less than 10), in which case it simply returns the input number as it is.

Otherwise, it uses the mathematical concept of digital root to obtain the sum of the digits of the input number. The digital root of a non-negative integer is obtained by repeatedly summing its digits until a single digit is obtained. For example, the digital root of 1234 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and the digital root of 10 is 1 + 0 = 1.

The formula used in the code to calculate the digital root of a number is based on the fact that the digital root of a number `n` is equal to `n` modulo 9, except when `n` is divisible by 9, in which case the digital root is 9. The formula is:

`digital_root(n) = (n - 1) % 9 + 1`

This formula is derived from the fact that `n` can be written as `9k + r` where `k` is a non-negative integer and `r` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 9. The digital root of `n` is then equal to the digital root of `r` when `r` is non-zero, and to 9 when `r` is zero (because `n` is divisible by 9).

In the code, the formula is simplified using integer division instead of modulo. The expression `(n - 1) / 9` computes the integer quotient of `n` divided by 9, which is the value of `k` in the above formula. Multiplying this value by 9 gives the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to `n`, which is subtracted from `n` to obtain the remainder `r`. Finally, the digital root of `n` is obtained by computing the digital root of `r` using the first line of the `addDigits` method.
