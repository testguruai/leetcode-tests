This Python code defines a class named "Solution" that has a method "getRow". This method takes an integer parameter called "rowIndex" and returns a list of integers. 

The "getRow" method generates and returns the "rowIndex"-th row of Pascal's triangle. The first row of the triangle contains only a single 1, and each subsequent row can be generated by adding adjacent numbers from the previous row, with 1's at the beginning and end of each row.

The code initializes two lists "last" and "res" with the value [1]. It then iterates through each row of the triangle, using the "last" list to generate the current row, and stores it in the "res" list. 

For each row, the code iterates through the "last" list and adds adjacent numbers together to generate the values for the "res" list. The resulting "res" list is then appended with a 1 on the right and stored in the "last" list for the next iteration until the "rowIndex"-th row is generated.

The code then returns the final generated "res" list, which contains the values for the "rowIndex"-th row of Pascal's triangle. 

Lastly, the "if __name__ == "__main__"" statement initiates the Solution object and prints the 3rd row of Pascal's triangle by calling the getRow method with a rowIndex of 3.
