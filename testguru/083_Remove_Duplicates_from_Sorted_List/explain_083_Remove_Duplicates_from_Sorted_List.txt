This is a python code for a function that takes in a singly-linked list and removes all duplicates from the list. Here is how it works:

- The function is defined as a method in a class called Solution.
- It has one parameter, `head`, which is the first node of the singly-linked list.
- The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is empty, it returns None.
- In the first implementation of the function (which is commented out), the function creates a new node called `temp` with a very large value (2147483647) and sets its next node to the head node of the input list. It then sets three pointers: `pos` and `last` to `head` and `head` to `temp`. The function then iterates over the input list and checks for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, `last.next` (the node before the current node) is set to `pos.next` (the next node in the list) to remove the duplicate node. If a duplicate is not found, the current position becomes the last position and the function moves on to the next node. Finally, the function returns the next node after `temp` in the input list.
- In the second implementation of the function, the function initializes `pos` to `head` and iterates over the list until it reaches the end or it finds two adjacent nodes with the same value. If it finds two adjacent nodes with the same value, it sets `pos.next` to `pos.next.next` to remove the duplicate node. If it finds two adjacent nodes with different values, it moves on to the next node. Finally, the function returns the head node of the modified list, which has all duplicates removed.
