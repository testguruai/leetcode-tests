This is a Python class called Solution that contains a method called floodFill. The floodFill method takes in an image (a 2-dimensional list of integers), an sr (an integer), an sc (an integer), and a newColor (an integer). The goal is to fill a region in the image surrounding the coordinates (sr, sc) with the newColor. This is done by changing the color of all pixels in the region that share the original color of the pixel at (sr, sc).

The first implementation of the floodFill method uses DFS (depth-first search) to search for and change the colors of the pixels in the region. It starts by initializing variables r_ls and c_ls to the length of the image's rows and columns, respectively, and getting the color of the pixel at (sr, sc). If the color is the same as the newColor, then the function just returns the original image. The method then defines a nested DFS function that takes in a row and column value, and recursively searches for adjacent pixels with the same color until it can no longer find any more. It then changes the color of each of these pixels to the newColor. Once the nested DFS function is done, the floodFill method calls it with the starting coordinates (sr, sc) and finally returns the modified image.

The second implementation of the floodFill method uses BFS (breadth-first search) with a queue to search for and change the colors of the pixels in the region. It has the same initializations as the first implementation, and the same check for whether the original color is the same as the newColor. However, the method then creates a queue (initialized to just the starting coordinates of the region), and starts a while loop. At each iteration of the loop, it dequeues the next pixel from the queue, checks if it has the same color as the original pixel, and if so, changes its color to the newColor and then enqueues any adjacent pixels with the same color. This process continues until the queue is empty (meaning all pixels in the region have been checked and changed). Finally, the method returns the modified image.
