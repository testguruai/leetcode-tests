This code defines a class called Solution that has a single method called poorPigs. The method takes in three arguments: buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest. 

The goal of this method is to determine the minimum number of pigs required to figure out the bucket that is poisoned within a certain time frame. The method uses the following logic:

1. First, it initializes a variable called "pigs" to 0.
2. It then enters a while loop. 
3. Within the while loop, it calculates a value using the given formula: 
      (minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) ** pigs, where ** means exponentiation.
4. It checks if the value calculated in step 3 is less than the total number of buckets.
5. If the value is less than the total number of buckets, it increments the number of pigs by 1 and repeats the process.
6. If the value is greater than or equal to the total number of buckets, it returns the current number of pigs.

Essentially, this algorithm checks how many times a group of pigs can sample the buckets within the given time frame and returns the minimum number of pigs required to confirm the poisoned bucket.
