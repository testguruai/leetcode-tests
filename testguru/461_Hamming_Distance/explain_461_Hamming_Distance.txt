This is a class definition for a Solution object in Python which has a method called `hammingDistance`. This method takes two integer arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns the Hamming distance between them. 

The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits in two integers are different. 

The method computes the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` using the ^ operator, which produces a new integer with bits set where the bits of `x` and `y` differ.

The result of the XOR operation is then passed to the `bin` function which returns the binary representation of the integer as a string. 

Finally, the `count` method is called on the binary string with the argument '1' which counts the number of '1' bits in the string, and this is returned as the Hamming distance between `x` and `y`.
