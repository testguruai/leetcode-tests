This code defines a class named `Solution`, which has a method called `nextPermutation` that modifies a list `nums` in place to get the lexicographically next greater permutation. It first finds a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `nums` such that `nums[i] < nums[j]` and `j` is maximum. Then it swaps `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and sorts the sublist from `i+1` to the end of the list in ascending order. If `nums` has no such pair of indices, the method sorts `nums` in ascending order. There is another version of `nextPermutation` method that is commented out, which follows a slightly different algorithm to achieve the same goal.
