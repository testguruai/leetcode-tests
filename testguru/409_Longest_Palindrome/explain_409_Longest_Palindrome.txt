This code defines a class "Solution" with a method "longestPalindrome" that takes a string "s" as input and returns the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed keeping the characters of the input string.

The function initializes "ans" to 0 and creates a dictionary "char_map" to keep track of the frequency of each character in the input string using the "get" method of the dictionary. The function then loops through the keys of the "char_map" dictionary and adds the frequency of all even occurrences of each character to "ans". For odd occurrences, it adds frequency / 2 * 2 to "ans" (this makes sure that only even frequencies are added to "ans").

If there are any characters with odd frequency remaining in the "char_map" dictionary, it means that these characters can be placed in the middle of the palindrome. Thus, "ans" is incremented by 1.

Finally, the function returns "ans".
