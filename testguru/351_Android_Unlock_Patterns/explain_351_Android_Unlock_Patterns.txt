This is a python class that defines a solution to a problem that involves finding all possible patterns of 3x3 matrix size. The class has three methods:

1. numberOfPatterns(self, m, n): This method takes two integer inputs (m and n), sets an array of 9 boolean values to False, and initializes a variable res to 0. A for loop is then used to iterate through all the values from m to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, the calc_patterns() method is called with the input for the boolean array and the value -1 (which indicates that no number was used before) to calculate the possible patterns. Finally, the boolean array is reset to all False and the total count of patterns is returned.

2. is_valid(self, used, index, last): This method takes three inputs - a boolean array indicating which numbers have been used, the index of the number being tested, and the index of the previously used number. The method then checks whether the number is already used (returns False if True), whether the number is the first one being used (returns True), whether the number is adjacent (in the same row or column) to the previously used number (returns True), whether the number is diagonal to the last number (returns True), or whether the number is not adjacent to the last number (returns the value of the boolean array at the midpoint between the two numbers).

3. calc_patterns(self, used, last, length): This method takes three inputs - a boolean array indicating which numbers have been used, the index of the previously used number, and the remaining length of the pattern being built. If the length is 0, the method returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers 0 to 8 and for each, checks whether it is a valid next number (using the is_valid() method), marks it as used, calls calc_patterns() recursively with the updated used array and the new number as last, then unmarks it and adds the returned value to the result. Finally, it returns the total count of patterns.
