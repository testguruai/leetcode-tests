This is a Python class named `Solution` that contains a method `generatePossibleNextMoves`. This method takes a string `s` as argument and returns a list of possible next moves that can be made from the input string.

The algorithm first initializes an empty list `res` to hold the result of possible next moves. It then checks if the input string provided is None or an empty string, in which case it returns an empty list.

Next, it defines the length of the input string `s` as `ls` and loops through the string using range from 0 to `ls-1`. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the current index i and the next index i+1 are both `+`. If so, it appends to the `res` list the string obtained by replacing these two characters with `--` using string slicing.

Finally, it returns the list `res` containing all the possible next moves.

An alternate, more concise implementation is also provided in the commented line, which uses a list comprehension and slices the string in a single line.
