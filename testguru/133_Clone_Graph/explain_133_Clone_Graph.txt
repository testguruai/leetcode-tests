This python code defines a class Solution with a method called cloneGraph. The cloneGraph method takes an object of class UndirectedGraphNode as input and returns an object of class UndirectedGraphNode as output. The method creates a deep copy of the input graph, which is an undirected graph, i.e., each node can have multiple neighbors. 

The graph is deep copied using either DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search). The commented out portion of the code uses the DFS approach, while the active portion of the code uses the BFS approach. Both approaches use a label_map dictionary to keep track of the mapping between the original nodes and the copied nodes. 

In the BFS approach, the method first creates a dictionary called label_map and a queue that initially contains only the input node. It then creates a node object called graphCopy that is a copy of the input node, and adds it to the label_map dictionary with the input node's label as key and graphCopy as value. 

Next, it begins to iterate through the queue, popping out nodes one by one. For each node in the queue, it looks at all its neighbors. If a neighbor's label is already present in the label_map dictionary, it means a copy of the node has already been created and added to the graphCopy object. Therefore, it simply adds the copied neighbor node to the current node's neighbors list. If a neighbor's label is not present in the label_map dictionary, then a new node object is created for it, added to the current node's neighbors list, added to the label_map dictionary with the appropriate key-value pair, and added to the queue for further exploration. Once all nodes have been explored and copied, the method returns the graphCopy object.
