This is a Python class `Solution` that contains a method `maxDepth` to find the maximum depth of a given binary tree, represented by its root node.

The method takes a single input argument, `root`, which is an instance of the `TreeNode` class that represents the root of the binary tree. 

The method first checks if the root is None, i.e., if the binary tree is empty. If so, it returns 0, since the depth of an empty tree is 0.

Otherwise, the method recursively calculates the maximum depth of the left subtree and the right subtree by calling `maxDepth` on the `left` and `right` child nodes of the current node, respectively. 

Finally, the maximum of these two depths is returned plus 1, which represents the depth of the current node, i.e., the root of the current subtree.

The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since it visits every node exactly once.
