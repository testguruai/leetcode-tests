This is a Python implementation of the "Recover Binary Search Tree" problem on LeetCode, which aims to recover a binary search tree (BST) where two of its nodes are swapped by swapping back the values of the two nodes. There are two solutions implemented in this code.

The first solution is commented out but is based on the Morris traversal algorithm. The Morris traversal algorithm is an in-order traversal algorithm that does not require explicit use of a stack or recursion. It works by connecting the rightmost node of the left subtree to the current node and then returning to the current node from the rightmost node of the left subtree. By doing this, it creates a threaded binary tree that allows us to traverse the tree in O(1) space. In this implementation, the algorithm is used to find the two swapped nodes in the BST and then swap their values back.

The second solution starts with the initialization of two pointers, "first" and "second", which will point to the two nodes that need to be swapped back in value. The "pre" pointer is also initialized to a dummy node with a value of negative infinity. The "traverse" function recursively traverses the BST in in-order fashion and checks if the current node violates the BST property by comparing its value to the value of the previous node ("pre"). If a violation is found, the first pointer is set to the previous node and the second pointer is set to the current node. The "pre" pointer is then updated to the current node. Once the traversal is complete, the values of the two nodes pointed to by the first and second pointers are swapped back.
